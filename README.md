# Blinker
Blinker is a typface by supertype’s Jürgen Huber. He’s nice enough to put up the fonts right here. Those of you who liked his 2002 FF Ginger will love the new Blinker.
The masters for the variable font are the weights Thin, Regular, Bold and Black. Blinker Headline is a stand-alone weight.
